## Hello World   [tutorial 1](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html)

## Work Queues   [tutorial 2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html)

Each task is delivered to exactly one worker.

### Round-robin dispatching

By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer, in sequence. On average every consumer will get the same number of messages. This way of distributing message is called **round-robin.**

### Message acknowledgments

Manual message acknowledgments are turned on by default.

Turn off:
`auto_ack=True`

If we want open it, just remove the tag.

```python
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print " [x] Received %r" % (body,)
    time.sleep( body.count('.')  )
    print " [x] Done"
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)

channel.basic_consume(queue='hello', on_message_callback=callback)
```

### Message durability

1. We need to make sure that RabbitMQ will never lose our queue. In order to do so, we need to declare it as *durable*
`channel.queue_declare(queue='hello', durable=True)`

2. We need to mark our messages as persistent - by supplying a delivery_mode property with a value 2.

```python
channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key="task_queue",
                      body=message,
                      properties=pika.BasicProperties(
                          delivery_mode = 2, # make message persistent
                      ))
```

### Fair dispatch

In order to defeat that we can use the basic.qos method with the prefetch_count=1 setting. This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than one message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one. Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.
`channel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)`

## Publish/Subscribe

Deliver a message to multiple consumers. ---publish/subscribe

### Exchanges

* A producer is a user application that sends messages.
* A queue is a buffer that stores messages.
* A consumer is a user application that receives messages.

producer -> exchange -> queue

_direct_, _topic_, _headers_, _fanout_

### Temporary queues

1. random queue:
`result = channel.queue_declare()`

2. Once the consumer connection is closed, the queue should be deleted. There's an *exclusive* flag for that:
`result = channel.queue_declare(exclusive=True)`

### Bindings

The relationship between exchange and a queue is called a binding.
'channel.queue_bind(exchange='logs', queue=result.method.queue)'
